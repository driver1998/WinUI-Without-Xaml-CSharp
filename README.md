# WinUI 3 Without XAML

This is a quick and dirty demo for using WinUI 3 without XAML, especially.

This might help other lanaguages to use WinUI without a working XAML compiler, like Rust and Swift.

This is mostly based on the C++ version by https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/discussions/8151.
