# WinUI 3 Without invoking the XAML compiler

This is a quick and dirty demo for using WinUI 3 with minimal XAML, especially, the XAML compiler is not invoked.

This might help other lanaguages to use WinUI without a working XAML compiler, like Rust and Swift.

Thanks @sylveon for the solution. See https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/discussions/7875#discussioncomment-4009438 and following discussion for more detail.
